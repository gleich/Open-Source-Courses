## ❓Why

The reasoning behind this course is that it is:

- Beneficial to me because teaching something **well** means truly understanding it.
- Beneficial to the community by providing a standard for making open source learning courses.
- Beneficial to you (the learner) by providing a direct course rather than other GitHub projects that merely point to collections of good classes.
